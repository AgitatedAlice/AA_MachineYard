# AA_MachineYard
 A collection of experiments, logs and half finished projects I can't place into a formal software project form.

 Included:
 - INCR, in all iterations from early testing to version 7, INCR needs further documentation at the time of writing. INCR is a very primitive computer that entirely relies on operating a tiny hardware stack, incrementing/decrementing registers and conditional execution based on whether the current memory cell is zero or not.
 - STACKER, in development prototype trying to stay true to the extremely primitive and reduced instruction set of INCR, yet with an actual ALU and less of a turing tarpit :)
 
 This is still very early as a repository, further documentation is needed. Files are intended for hneeman's logic sim "Digital" which you can find here on github.
